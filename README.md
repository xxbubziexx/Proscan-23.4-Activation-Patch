# Proscan-23.4-Activation-Patch
Proscan 23.4 Activation Patch. All-In-One Computer Aided Scanning Program.
This is my first ever approach with patching software :D
After years of using this program, I decided to look into patching this myself with the help of gpt. With the inspiration of the github user "stoom" which whom patched a earlier version of this program. 
I pretty much followed his method but with gpt's help because i am only just 'familiar' with coding.
Heres his version: https://gist.github.com/Stoom/81c0521305a7d95e0ba1c530f6fd647c


Heres how it works:
Me and GPT used dnspy to figure out how to bypass the server-side activation check. So any registration name and key will work. After this the program is considered activated, and never checks with the server again. On restarting the program, it reads from the registry and is still considered Registered & Activated.
Hope u guys enjoy the fully activated version of proscan!
